## Decisions:

  - Implement everything in compose: This decision aims to implement and learn more about the framework. Also to show that I could write code in a totally new framework
  - Hilt: same as compose, I've strong experience with koin, for that reason I wanted to try something new

## Inprovement areas:

 - Implement Crashlytics
 - Implement proguard

## Missing feature:
